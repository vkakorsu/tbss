  <h1>About TBSS</h1>
  <p>
    Torchbearers Books & Stationery Services (TBSS) started as a small table of
    paperbacks and exercise books in Ho, serving students who needed trusted,
    affordable materials. Over time, that table grew into a full bookshop:
    shelves of Ghanaian titles, African literature, school texts, and stationery
    for learners at every level.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today TBSS is a warm corner for readers – a place where parents discover
    stories for their children, students find the books they need for class, and
    curious readers explore staff picks from Ghana and beyond. We focus on
    practical service: clear recommendations, honest advice, and delivery
    options that work for busy school terms.
